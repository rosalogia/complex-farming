# Complex Farming

This is a likely outdated Minecraft plug-in I wrote using the Spigot API in Kotlin that
adds a layer or two of complexity to the built-in farming system, incorporating temperature
and soil nutrition into the way crops grow. It was written in 2017 and is uploaded here for
viewing purposes.
